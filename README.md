My objectives on the opportunities that I am looking for are the following. I think that business outcome should be considered the first and foremost priority of the firm more than any cutting-edge technologies. However, if the firms have a tangible vision and roadmap for their future business and technology innovations, I believe that cutting-edge technologies can drive to accelerate the business even in the next-stage of technology innovations. I confirm that combining my expertises working as a business consultant and data scientist, I can contribute to the firm for achievements of business outcomes and driving the future innovations through the appropriate use of technologies and data analytics.
